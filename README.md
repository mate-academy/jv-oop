- Create class Machine containing methods `public abstract void doWork()` and `public abstract void stopWork()`.  
- Create classes `Truck`, `Bulldozer`, and `Excavator` that will inherit from `Machine`.
- In those classes override `doWork()`, so it will print a message that a certain machine started its work.
- Override `stopWork()` as well. It should print messages that certain machines stopped working.
- In the `MainApp` class create a `Machine` array with `Truck`, `Bulldozer`, and `Excavator` and call methods `doWork()` and `stopWork()` in a loop.
