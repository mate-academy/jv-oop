- Create class core.basesyntax.Machine containing methods `public abstract void doWork()` and `public abstract void stopWork()`.  
- Create classes `Truck`, `Bulldozer`, `Excavator` that will inherit from `core.basesyntax.Machine`.
- In those classes override `doWork()`, so it will print message that certain machine started its work.
- Override `stopWork()` as well. It should print messages that certain machine stopped its work.
- In `MainApp` class create `core.basesyntax.Machine` array with `Truck`, `Bulldozer` and `Excavator` and call methods `doWork()` and `stopWork()` in a loop.
