- Create class core.basesyntax.Machine containing methods `public abstract void doWork()` and `public abstract void stopWork()`.  
- Create classes `core.basesyntax.Truck`, `core.basesyntax.Bulldozer`, `Excavator` that will inherit from `core.basesyntax.Machine`.
- In those classes override `doWork()`, so it will print message that certain machine started its work.
- Override `stopWork()` as well. It should print messages that certain machine stopped its work.
- In `Main` class create an object of each class.
- Start work of all machines and then stop them.
